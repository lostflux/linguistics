\section{N-grams}~\label{sec:n-grams}

I chose to use the Swahili dataset for this section.

\textbf{Analysis}

While some local phrases seem to make sense,
the generated sentences and the whole paragraph
does not make sense at all since it hops from one line
of thought to another without ever completing any of them.

\textbf{Analysis}

This paragraph is clearly an improvement from the previous one.
No idea or statement is completed, and the following
sentence is unrelated to the previous one.

=========================================
\end{verbatim}
\end{center}

\textbf{Analysis}

This paragraph reads like one by a learning student who knows
\emph{how to connect words} but does not know
\emph{how to connect ideas}.
It is better than the previous two paragraphs;
some sentences such as \verb|he said the government has always allocated 2.5 trillion Tanzanian shs|
almost makes sense. One of the clear problems seems to be that the model
does not seem to know when and how to end a sentence, so some ideas are left hanging
while others are awkwardly concatenated to different ideas.

\textbf{Analysis}

This paragraph is slightly better than the previous one,
but it mostly suffers from the same issues;
incomplete ideas (albeit mostly longer and better)
and the next sentence is unrelated to the current one.

  \item Sentence (3) has the highest perplexity of infinity.
    This is because the sentence contains a word that does not appear in the training set at all.
    In fact, looking at the bigram probabilities (run the source-code if interested),
    it seems a lot of contiguous words in the sentence have zero probability.

  \item Sentence (2) has the lowest perplexity.
    This is because the sentence was generated using the model.
    In fact, out of curiosity, I dug into the dataset and discovered that the sentence
    actually occurs in the dataset (even though I hadn't manually selected it
    from the dataset).
  \item Sentence (1), which actually appears in the dataset, does not have the lowest
    perplexity. This makes me think of two things:
    [1] It is probably not always a good idea to use perplexity
    as a measure of how good a sentence is, since some better sentences might
    have higher perplexity than some worse sentences.
    [2] Perhaps sentence (2) was generated over sentence (1) because of its lower perplexity.
