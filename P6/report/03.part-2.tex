% how to include kigo and kireji in haiku
One way to enforce the inclusion of a kigo and kireji in a haiku is to add them as custom symbols in the CFG,
in the right positions, and defining specific words as terminals for kigo and kireji.
This way, the haiku generator will always include them in the generated haikus.
