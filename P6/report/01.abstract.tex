% 	Visualization of attention mechanisms in neural machine translation (NMT) models
% 	is a crucial tool for understanding the inner workings of these models.
% 	In this report, we present a visualization of the attention mechanism in an NMT model.
% 	We use the attention mechanism to visualize the alignment between the source and target sentences.
